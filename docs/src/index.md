# {#reach-top} Reach: The Fastest, Safest and Smartest DApp Programming Language

Reach is an interoperable, high-level, domain-specific language 
and is the most advantageous way to build decentralized applications (DApps) for the blockchain.

Reach enables full stack developers to grow from web2 developer to web3 Reach Engineer in six weeks or less.

This collection of documents, guides, and tutorials contain everything you need to know about Reach.

## First Introduction to Reach

If this is your first experience with Reach, 
then proceed directly to our [quick start](##quickstart) guide for clear directions that will help you install Reach on Windows, Linux, and MacOS operating systems.

STOP! Only proceed past this point if you've successfully [installed Reach](##quickstart).

## Reach is Installed and Ready to Learn

_You've successfully installed Reach and are ready to begin your journey in web3 with Reach!_

Learn Reach with our [tutorial](##tut). 
The [tutorial](##tut) is a directed series of steps that teaches participants how to create a Reach DApp. 
It assumes no prior experience in DApp or blockchain development.

Be sure to let us know when you complete [the tutorial](##tut)!

## Next Steps for Tutorial Veterans

Tutorial Veterans should feel empowered to build their own web3 DApps with Reach. 
We want to support your growth as a web3 Reach developer.

If you're looking for additional learning materials, then check out our [workshops](##workshop).
The workshops offer a series of self-study projects to help you gain mastery in decentralized application design through practice with Reach. 
Each project contains a completed solution. 
Workshops offer a collection of recipes, demonstrates effective use of Reach, 
and indirectly teaches design decisions that Reach programmers face.

If you're interested in learning specific topics about Reach development then check out our [guides](##guide). 
The guides continue concepts discussed in [the overview](##overview). 
They can be utilized to reinforce background knowledge and help Tutorial Veterans understand the "why" of newly learned topics.

If there's a topic you'd like to learn about that is not included in the guides, 
let us know in [Discord](@{DISCORD}) so we can add your suggestion to our road map.
